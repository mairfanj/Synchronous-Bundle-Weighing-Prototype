ðŸ“š Explanation of the Code:

âœ… 1. Initialization (setup())
LCD: Initialized for user display.
LoRa: Communication module is set up.
Master Mode Detection: The device detects if a keypad is connected. If not, it halts execution.

âœ… 2. Calibration (calibrateDevice())
Prompt the user to place one copy on the scale.
Simulates weight measurement (copyWeight).

âœ… 3. Broadcast Calibration Data (broadcastCalibration())
Sends calibration data (copyWeight) to all slave devices via LoRa.
Displays a confirmation message.

âœ… 4. State Management (loop())
The loop() function cycles through the states: CALIBRATE, BROADCAST, and IDLE.

âš¡ Next Steps:
Copy and paste the code into your Arduino IDE.
Install the required libraries:
- LiquidCrystal_I2C
- LoRa
Test the calibration flow.
Ensure the LoRa message is broadcast successfully.
